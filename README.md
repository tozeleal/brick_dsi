# BrickNDSi-Prank
The first bootloader error prank for the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo DSi XL users!
Built in C++ with Devkitpro and with drunkencoders API for displaying bitmap images.

## How to use:
Just download the NDS file and place it on your Flashcard or SDcard (if you already have an hacked DSi) and run it!
Btw there is a secret menu so try find it!
